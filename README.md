# react-mosaic

A powerful, flexible mosaic layout component built on react-mosaic-component that allows users to create customizable dashboard layouts with draggable, resizable widgets.

## Overview

The `react-mosaic-component` provides a complete solution for creating dynamic dashboard layouts where users can:

- Drag and drop widgets to rearrange their workspace
- Resize panels with intuitive split handles
- Show/hide widgets through a context menu
- Maintain their layout preferences

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install react-mosaic-component
```

### Component Structure

Copy these files to your project:

- `components/mosaic-container` (e subdiret√≥rios)

## How to use this template

This repository is ready to use with `react-mosaic-component` and provides an example dashboard with customizable widgets. Follow the steps below to run and adapt it to your project:

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Run the project locally

```bash
npm run dev
```
The project will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

### 3. Widget structure

Widgets are defined in `src/components/ComponentA.tsx`, `ComponentB.tsx`, and `ComponentC.tsx`. You can create new components and add them to the `ALL_WIDGETS` array in `App.tsx`.

### 4. Initial layout

The initial dashboard layout is defined by the `INITIAL_LAYOUT` constant in `App.tsx`. You can customize the initial arrangement of widgets by editing this structure.

Users can add or remove widgets using the selection menu (gear icon) at the top of the screen. The layout will adjust automatically.

### 6. Resetting the layout

Click the "Restore" button to return to the default layout.

### 7. Customization

- To customize the appearance, edit the CSS files in `components/mosaic-container/mosaic-container.css`.
- To change the widget toolbar, edit `components/mosaic-container/toolbar`.
- For layout logic, use the `useMosaicLayout` hook.

### 8. Example usage of MosaicContainer

See in `App.tsx` how `MosaicContainer` is used:

```tsx
<MosaicContainer
  widgets={activeWidgets}
  value={layout}
  onChange={handleLayoutChange}
  onWidgetClose={handleWidgetClose}
  zeroStateView={null}
  defaultBackgroundColor="#ffffff"
/>
```
